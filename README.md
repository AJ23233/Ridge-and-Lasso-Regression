# Ridge-and-Lasso-Regression
This reporsitory demonstrates the use of Ridge and Lasso regression which can be used to prevent over-fitting which may result from simple linear regression.

> Regularization (L2) Ridge : In ridge regression, the cost function is altered by adding a penalty equivalent to square of the magnitude of the coefficients.

> Regularization (L1) Lasso : The only difference is instead of taking the square of the coefficients, magnitudes are taken into account. This type of regularization (L1) can lead to zero coefficients i.e. some of the features are completely neglected for the evaluation of output. So Lasso regression not only helps in reducing over-fitting but it can help us in feature selection
